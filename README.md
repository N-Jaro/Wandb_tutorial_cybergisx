# CyberGISX Jupyter Notebooks

Welcome to the repository for Jupyter Notebooks specifically designed for the CyberGISX platform. These notebooks have been tested with the `geoai-Python3-0.9.5` kernel to ensure compatibility and performance.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks tailored for use with the CyberGISX platform. These notebooks cover various topics, including machine learning, geospatial analysis, and the use of tools like Weights and Biases (WandB) for experiment tracking and optimization.

## Notebooks

### Introduction to Weights and Biases (WandB)

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to using WandB for tracking and optimizing machine learning experiments. It includes examples ranging from basic setup and logging to advanced features like hyperparameter tuning with WandB Sweeps.

#### Contents

- **Introduction**: Common challenges in machine learning and how WandB can help.
- **Getting Started**: Creating a WandB account, setting up a project, and integrating WandB with ML scripts.
- **Basic Example**: Logging simple metrics and visualizing results in the WandB dashboard.
- **Intermediate Features**: Creating custom charts, comparing multiple runs, and collaborating with team members.
- **Advanced Features**: Hyperparameter tuning with Sweeps, advanced logging, and integrations with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Case Study**: Real-world example from a CyberGIS project demonstrating the benefits of using WandB.
